Features:

Preprocessing of email text (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings
Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models
Deployment-ready API for real-time spam detection
Tech Stack:

Python, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, Flask (for API deployment)
